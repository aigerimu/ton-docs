# Blockchain

A **blockchain** is a chain of blocks, each containing information that all participants in the network can access and trust. Every block is securely linked to the previous one, and the entire chain is continuously replicated and synchronized across the network.

The following key properties characterize a blockchain:

- **Immutable** – once data is added, it cannot be modified or removed.
- **Decentralized** – no single authority governs the chain; it is maintained collectively by network participants.
- **Transparent** – all data is openly accessible, enabling anyone to verify the integrity and history of the chain.
