# Asynchrony

**Asynchrony** is the property of a system where events, actions, or processes happen independently, without waiting for other operations to complete.

_Asynchrony is the opposite of synchrony_, which means that operations occur one after another in a fixed order, and each step must wait for the previous one to complete before proceeding.

## Asynchrony in TON

In TON, **each account works independently**. Think of an account as a small worker that handles only its tasks.

- An account receives messages instructing it how to act.
- Each account processes its messages one by one, in order, at its own pace.
- **Accounts do not wait for each other** — one account can finish its work while others are still busy.
- On a single account, the result of each task is recorded as a *transaction*, showing precisely what changes were made to that account.

### Real-life analogy

Imagine a city where every resident (account) has a mailbox.
1. A resident takes a letter (task) and takes time to complete it.
2. While they are busy, new letters can arrive, but they don’t process them yet.
3. After finishing, they pick up the next letter.
4. Meanwhile, other residents are doing the same _independently_, so letters are being processed at different speeds by different residents (accounts).


The key idea is that each account operates _independently of the others_, processing its tasks sequentially. Since accounts operate independently, the overall order in which tasks are completed across accounts is not predetermined. This independence between accounts is what makes TON **asynchronous**.
